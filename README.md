# Challenge-55-Rose

## Example:
![gif of rose](https://i.gyazo.com/a15b5d1d3ce3581eb21525f20b6d406a.gif)

I created a move function for the flower. You can change the position of the flower on the screen by changing those values.

I didn't have enough time to perfect the moving by the x and y value of the mouse. Although, it can be done by using the same formula that orginally created the circle, but changing it slightly to move it to the center of the mouse pressed.

I also changed minor things, like the stroke weight, background and some things about algorithm of the flower.
